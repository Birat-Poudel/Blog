## 👋 Hey

I'm a **Data Scientist & AI/ML Engineer** with expertise in building production-ready AI systems that solve real-world problems. Currently working at **Leapfrog Technology**, I specialize in developing **conversational AI, voice systems, and intelligent agents** while maintaining strong backend engineering foundations.

I excel at transforming complex ML research into scalable production systems—whether it's:  
- Building **IVR systems and Conversational Voice AI** for medical patient follow-ups and referrals  
- Developing **AI Voice Interviewers** and intelligent chatbots with 10+ service integrations (Google Calendar, Zoom, Gmail, etc.)  
- Creating **match score algorithms** using advanced NLP to optimize candidate-job matching  
- Engineering **RAG-based systems, semantic search, and time series forecasting models** with 15%+ accuracy improvements  
- Orchestrating **AI Agent Frameworks and MCP Servers** for scalable agent orchestration
